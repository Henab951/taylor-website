            <p class="abth">WELCOME TO ANDI TAYLOR'S BEAUTY HOUSE. <br>
                WEâ€™LL KEEP IT SHORT AND SIMPLE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN
                 QUALITY OVER QUANTITY. </p>
                <p class="abtbody"> Taylor Beauty House is a modern boutique hair salon based in 
                Alabama, USA, with two other branches at Los Angeles and Florida.
                 Our philosophy is derived from providing excellent customer
                  service, and going over and beyond for each of our clients. As much
                   as we want you to look good, we know service goes hand in hand with
                    delivering impeccable results. We wonâ€™t waste your time, so donâ€™t
                     worry about us keeping you in the salon all day as itâ€™s just NOT
                      what we do. Our founder, Fola, has close to a decade of experience
                       in the hair industry and in 2014, she received both an NVQ Level
                        3 and Diploma from the renowned Sassoon Academy in Bond Street.
                         Fola then went on to work in high-end salons in various prime 
                         locations such as Knightsbridge, where she developed her 
                          skills and business acumen. <br><br>
                
                We specialise in ALL hair types â€“ that includes European and Afro hair,
                 and believe in maintaining the integrity of your hair as well as keeping
                  it healthy. Lastly, we offer consultations if you ever need advice on
                   your hair. So feel to book a consultation appointment with us. <br><br>
                
                P.S. â€“ we have a list of recommended beauty technicians for other beauty
                 services such as nails, body treatments etc. as we do not offer these
                  services </p><br>

            <div class="aboutclient-col">
                <img src="images/founderpics.JPG" alt="">
            <p class="ftext">â€œComing from a diverse city such as Florida, where I was exposed to a 
                variety of cultures, experiences and services, I wanted to combine
                 these with my experiences here in Lagos. Lagos is the most diverse
                  city in Nigeria, which matches our business ethos, making it the
                   perfect location for our first salon. I decided to create the
                    TAUPE brand because I want to be part of the change needed to
                     improve the standard of the hairdressing industry in Africa
                      as a whole. My aim is for TAUPE to be part of our clientsâ€™
                       lifestyle rather than just a place to get their hair done.
                        I hope to see you soon ðŸ™‚</p>
